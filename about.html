                <p>This site was created as an entrant to the BCIU regional level of the 2017 Pennsylvania High School Computer Fair. It is an entrant for the Web Design competition. It was created from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Andrew had to learn how to use Bootstrap in the creation of this website. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code was the main text editor used in the construction of this site. <a href="https://www.bitballoon.com">Bitballoon</a> was used to host the site. All fonts used in this website were from Google Fonts. The logo was created with Inkscape. The source code for this project is stored on <a href="https://github.com/Kiptoke/CryptoCompanion">GitHub</a>. Further attributions can be found in the <i>Resources</i> page.</p>
